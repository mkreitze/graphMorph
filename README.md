# Graph Morphs (maybe rename?)
# In short 
Graph morphs are a method to visualize all behaviours attained from a complete graph of linear morphs between multiple Fashion Based Cellular Automata. This is done through visualizing a planar graph with verticies being each FBCA in the set and the edges being these linear morphs between each. This has shown to be a very easy method to describe similar score matrices for FBCA with an arbtirary number of states and, with small edits, should be able to visualize a 'pseudo phase portrait' for FBCAs an arbitrary number of states.  

To use any of this software download the folder 'code'.
The following libraries are needed to run this: os, numpy, matplotlib, math and PIL to run this software.
To generate all linear morphs between an inputted set use FmultiMorph.py. This code is run using the command 'python3 FmultiMorph.py'
To generate planar views of linear morphs for a set (and also record all unique behaviours found by the graph morph) use FgraphMorph.py.
This code is run using the command 'python3  FgraphMorph.py'

# Introduction
To start, one must be familiar with (FBCA; described in Section 1.1 , Linear morphs; described in Section 3.1, Behaviours; described in Section 2.1 and Phase Portraits described in Section 3.3 of https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/21316). These are also defined in the following papers (and are slightly more easy to read): . To better understand what the problem of visualizing the behaviours of FBCAs condsider the following example.

# A simple example
Consider the following two FBCAs with 2 states which both produce a behaviour that is organized enough to be used in level map generation:
sM1:[0.320205, 0.952292, 0.351335, 0.837774] : 

![sM1](https://github.com/mkreitze/graphMorph/blob/master/multipleMorphs/fingerprintMethod/graphMorph/test/0/0%2020.png)

sM2:[[0.390741, 0.728013, 0.614486, 0.378596]

![sM2](https://github.com/mkreitze/graphMorph/blob/master/multipleMorphs/fingerprintMethod/graphMorph/test/1/1%2020.png)

To add more complexity and better understand where similar matrices may be found in FBCAs with more states, a method known as crisscrossing (detailed here: https://github.com/mkreitze/crissCross {name change?}) was used. This method takes the two score matrices sM1 and sM2 and used them as the rows for the higher state FBCAs. These are denoted by the order each row (top down) is used. For example, sM(1,1,1,1) has the first score matrix used every time, as the rows of the four state score matrix. The number of options produced by this crisscrossing is the same as the number of possibilities generated by a two character alphabet on a four member string. All 2^4 = 16 options are recorded below.

While 16 generated score matrices is useful. The number of linear morphs generated is 136, considerably higher than 16. This comes from the completed graph having the number of edges equal to the sum from 0 to i of n, with i being the number of members. 

To better visualize each of the 136 linear morphs, 16 planar graphs are generated. Due to current complications the top nine score matrices and their associated planar graphs are generated below. 
##Each vertex should be named to make the planar graphs easier to visualize. ##

# Visualizing higher dimension FBCA space
Previous work with FBCAs revealed that FBCAs can be effectively sorted by their score matrices, provided all other paramters are held constant. Sorting by all possible score matrices is effective as all possible patterns (called behaviours due to patterns having some intrinsic property to them) produced by a FBCA can be recorded. The main issue with this method is the number of dimensions required to visualize the behaviours of FBCAs with more than two states. Since the dimension an FBCA's score matrices is the square of its number of states (_n_ > 1, in N) any method of visualziing all behaviours past the _n_ = 2 state case, (detailed in Section 3.3 here  https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/21316) is not easily done. To combat this a new method for visualizing this higher dimensional space is required. 

# Polyvision (name changeable)
While arbitrarily high dimensional dimensional space is difficult to visualize, any 2D convex cross section can be visualzied using a phase portrait. If 2D convex cross sections are smartly chosen, then all behaviours should be recordable. For now we shall ignore the problem of _smartly_ choosing behaviours and instead create a software to visualize these 2D convex cross sections. This is done through Polyvision and uses
